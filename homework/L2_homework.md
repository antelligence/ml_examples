#### Game 2 :  Tic-Tac-Toe

Build your Tic-Tac-Toe game from Scratch. The function should:
- Create a 3x3 game board 
- Allow Player 1 and Player 2 to play their turn. 
- At each turn, player will mark their position. 
- Evaluate the board after each move to check whether a row or column or a diagonal has the same player number.
- If win, show won player. The game will draw if no one wins after 9 moves.

Game Flow Example:
1. Create Empty Board
2. Player 1 enter position
3. Check Status
4. Player 2 enter position
5. Check Status
6. Continue until there is a winner or it is a draw game.
