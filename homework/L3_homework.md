## Homework: L3

#### Question 1:  Consecutive Characters
Write a function to find the length of the longest substring that contains only one unique character.
Constraints:

Input is a non-empty string without spaces


Example 1:  
Input: "e"
Output: 1

Example 2:  
Input: "ee"
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: "triplepillooooow"
Output: 5  (o is the longest substring)

#### Question 2: Fibonacci Sequence

Write a function to obtain Fibonacci Sequence. 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,...

The series starts with 0 and 1 as the first two numbers in the series. 

The next number in the series is found by summing the two numbers before it.

f(0) = 0
f(1) = 1
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: n = 6
Output: 8
